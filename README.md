## Welcome

### About Me

Hi, I'm Dan. This is a collection of some personal projects, which are more for myself than anything else. I started coding December 2020 and love it :rocket:

I'm very interested in Machine Learning and risk, if you want to talk about it, reach out!

### Current Projects :hammer:
1. Website using HTML and CSS (maybe a little JavaScript?)
2. Scrape Discord for messages using a webserver
3. Build a generative text model (for the discord messages + it's fun)
